# ProjectZenitsu

This is my first try for a professional website / good php code.
This means:

- Object oriented PHP
- Modeling according to the MVC / MVP model
- Following SOLID principles

This website should represent a small social network.
The name "Zenitsu" is temporary as it's just a codename.
It reffers to a character from the Kimetsu no Yaiba manga series, as I couldn't come up with a fitting name and needed a project name.
Within the site, one should be able to create and delete posts, like them and follow a user or a label.

The project was done using:

- MySQL
- Vanilla PHP

# Setup

A backup of the database is in \ProjectZenitsu\Database\ProjectZenitsuDB.sql.
The MySQL user info is commented out. Please create the user with this data manually.

You should be good to go!
